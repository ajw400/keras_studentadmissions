# Student Acceptance Classification with a Neural Network Using Keras

This project demonstrates how to train a neural network using keras in order to solve a classification problem. In this case, the neural network is trained to predict the admissions decision to UCLA based on several data points. To see how to accomplish this by hand (without using keras) please check out this repository: [Student Admissions - by hand](https://github.com/ajw400/studentadmissions)

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

It is recommended to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `studentadmissions/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook StudentAdmissions.ipynb
```
or
```bash
jupyter notebook StudentAdmissions.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
